# Deep Learning - Self-Organising Maps
Self-Organising Maps is a Neural network based on the philosophy of arrangment of neural pathways in our brain.
<br>One of its application is in the field of dimensionality reduction and visualization in low-dimensional space, however, it has been used and proven to effective for almost every field of Analytics.
</br><br>The code here is an implementation of basic SOM in Python.</br>
